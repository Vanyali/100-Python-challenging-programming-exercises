# 100-Python-challenging-programming-exercises
## Python Exercises in Python i found in github.

I am relatively new to Python and IT in general. I found these tutorial on [Github Zhiwehu Repository](https://github.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises).
I wanna thank him. I could probably use fork or other utilities of git and github so people know where it came. But i am not quite sure
how it works yet. I will find out soon enough and change it accordingly.

**Python version is: 3.6.5**

* *Almost all exercises is my own solutions but some don't belong to me either because i was struggling in some point or i just didn't like my solution 
at all.* *

This exercises helped me alot but i still have so much to learn.
